## What we're about

Ultimately this set of Github repositories are going to host a multitude of .NET
Solutions following security-focused best practises.

Over the next few weeks we'll be looking at modular approaches to .NET Web Application
Development. Utilising libraries such as the epic [NWebSec](https://github.com/NWebsec/NWebsec)

We'll take a gander at the secure transportation of user data, the storage and processing
of said data. See if we can't comprise a nice section of repositories dedicated to a
set of disparate modules, pluggable in their nature, optional, and neatly featureful!
